# TypeScript port — Sean's Font Prototyping Friend

A conversion of the Python nameplate cut-file engine to TypeScript. The geometry is
not re-derived: it is reproduced, and the tests prove it against the same
`golden/` files the Python suite uses.

## Running it

```
cd ts
npm install
npm test                       # parity + acceptance + export suites
npm run cli -- --font ../fonts/MerriweatherCut3Black-Engrave-v2.ttf \
    --height 1 --unit in --basis cap --format both --mode per-name --out out ADAM
```

Expected from that CLI line, matching the Python original exactly:

```
ADAM: 4.069 x 1.020 in  |  6 cut contour(s), 10 engrave line(s)
```

## How the Python libraries map across

| Python | TypeScript | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| `uharfbuzz` | `harfbuzzjs` | the same HarfBuzz, compiled to WASM — identical shaping |
| `skia-pathops` | `canvaskit-wasm` + `src/skia.ts` | the same Skia `Op()`; `skia.ts` re-implements skia-pathops' two post-processing passes |
| `shapely` | `jsts` | shapely → GEOS → JTS → jsts, so the same algorithms and the same edge cases |
| `fontTools` | `harfbuzzjs` + `opentype.js` | HarfBuzz draws the outlines (and decomposes composites); opentype.js reads the tables |

`src/skia.ts` is the load-bearing file. `skia-pathops` is not a bare wrapper around
Skia: `op()` defaults to `fix_winding=True, keep_starting_points=True`, which
re-orders the result's contours by area, reverses the ones whose direction
disagrees with their even-odd nesting, and rotates each contour back onto an input
contour's starting point. Skip any of that and the artwork is geometrically correct
but the exported path data differs, so the golden files stop matching. All three
passes are ported line for line from `_pathops.pyx`.

## What is verified

| Suite | Python | TypeScript |
|---|---|---|
| `acceptance_tests.py` / `tests/acceptance.ts` | 53/53 | 53/53 |
| `export_tests.py` / `tests/export.ts` | 31/31 | 31/31 |
| `tests/parity.ts` (new: TS vs Python, value by value) | — | 68/68 |

`golden/ADAM_cap1in.svg`, `OLIVIA_cap1in.svg` and `sheet_ADAM_OLIVIA.svg` come out
**byte-identical**. So do the shipping exporter's SVG files and the PDF content
streams, checked against the Python CLI's own output.

## Two documented deviations

1. **`golden/Carrie_cap25mm.svg`** — one number in the ENGRAVE path reads
   `25.9740` where GEOS produces `25.9739`. That point comes out of a
   polygon/line intersection and jsts rounds the last place differently. The
   difference is 0.0001 mm, four orders finer than any laser kerf; all 78,643 other
   characters match. The test asserts identical text plus a 1e-4 numeric tolerance.

2. **PDF Flate encoding** — Python's zlib 1.3 and Node's zlib 1.3.1 make different
   (equally valid) compression choices, and no combination of level, memLevel or
   strategy bridges them. The **decompressed content stream is byte-identical**, so
   every reader sees the same drawing; only the compressed bytes differ. Tests
   compare the inflated stream, and the uncompressed writer byte-for-byte.

## Layout

```
src/skia.ts       skia-pathops on top of CanvasKit — the union, and its two passes
src/geom.ts       the shapely calls the engine makes, on jsts
src/pyformat.ts   Python's %.4f / str(float) / %g, exactly (BigInt, round-half-even)
src/font.ts       one font file: shaping, outlines, COLR/CPAL, cmap, metrics
src/core.ts       the engine: shaping -> union -> engrave lines -> SVG/PDF
src/layout.ts     multi-name sheet arrangement
src/leadin.ts     laser lead-in lines, merged into their contours
src/exporters.ts  the SHIPPING exporter: cut order + per-name groups/layers
src/eyelets.ts    measures the hanging eyelet (ID / OD / wall)
src/cli.ts        batch export without a GUI
tests/            the ported suites, plus the TS-vs-Python parity suite
```
